What is ETL
abberviation Extract Transfer and Load
Extract, transform, and load (ETL) is the process data-driven organizations use to gather data from multiple sources and then bring it together to support discovery, reporting, analysis, and decision-making.

The data sources can be very diverse in type, format, volume, and reliability, so the data needs to be processed to be useful when brought together. The target data stores may be databases, data warehouses, or data lakes, depending on the goals and technical implementation.

The three distinct steps of ETL
Extract
During extraction, ETL identifies the data and copies it from its sources, so it can transport the data to the target datastore. The data can come from structured and unstructured sources, including documents, emails, business applications, databases, equipment, sensors, third parties, and more.

Transform
Because the extracted data is raw in its original form, it needs to be mapped and transformed to prepare it for the eventual datastore. In the transformation process, ETL validates, authenticates, deduplicates, and/or aggregates the data in ways that make the resulting data reliable and queryable.

Load
ETL moves the transformed data into the target datastore. This step can entail the initial loading of all the source data, or it can be the loading of incremental changes in the source data. You can load the data in real time or in scheduled batches.
